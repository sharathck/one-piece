        <p>Zoro is a character from the anime and manga series One Piece  and is my favorite character cause of his focus and unique way of handling his swords one bad thing he's known for is his sense of direction and getting lost often. He is also Luffy's first mate and crew member. Zoro has 3 swords 2 of those swords were for him and the last one was Kuina's sword. In Zoro's back story Kuina was Zoro's only friend and when she died cause of a tragic accident Zoro took her swords to fulfill his promise to be the worlds strongest swordsman. Zoro came on Monkey.D.Luffy's crew when Luffy saved Zoro from an execution.</p>
